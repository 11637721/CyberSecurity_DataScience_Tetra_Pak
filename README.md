# CyberSecurity_DataScience_Tetra_Pak
 
## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance cybersecurity within the manufacturing sector, focusing on Tetra Pak. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, we analyze extensive network traffic data to detect potential cybersecurity threats with high accuracy and precision.
 
## Key Features
- Effective threat detection model based on Random Forest Classifier.
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insightful feature identification.
- Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- Documentation on methodology, findings, and feature importance analysis.
